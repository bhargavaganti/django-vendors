==============
Django Vendors
==============

Overview
--------

A django application for managing vendors at a farmer's, or other kind of, market.

Dependencies
------------

One part of the app requires django-schedule to work propertly. This can be circumvented quite easily by commenting out the appropriate parts of the models.py and views.py files.

Each vendor can sign up for an "Event," which is supposed to be a market day, but could be anything.

Flow
------

New vendor -> register for account -> create application

Admin -> vets info -> approves/declines application
